# MAPP Parser

[MAPP](http://draco.eecs.berkeley.edu/dracotiki/tiki-index.php?page=MAPP) is an open source circuit and algorithm simulator written in Matlab. It has components that are similar to SPICE, a commonly used circuit/algorithm simulator, but it also has functionality not found in SPICE.

This parser makes the switch from SPICE to MAPP easy by converting SPICE netlists to MAPP netlists.

## Current Functionality

The MAPP parser can currently parse:
